Developer Setup
===============

1. Requires Java 1.8.

Configuration
=============

Manual usage
============

Using the SDK simply requires including the included here-oauth-client JAR file in your project's classpath.

NOTE: This library requires the here-oauth-client JAR file as well as the JAR files
in the /lib directory to be available on your classpath.  By default, the /lib JARs
are referenced in the here-oauth-client's Class-Path.

Documentation
===============

Read the javadocs for details, included in the /javadoc directory.  Open the /javadoc/index.html
to get started.  To skip ahead, go to HereAccount.java javadocs for the overview of two options:
- get an "always fresh" HERE Access Token via TokenEndpoint.requestAutoRefreshingToken(..) approach
- get a one time use HERE Access Token via TokenEndpoint.requestToken(..) approach
