HERE Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting

Introduction
============
The here-oauth-client JAR includes
- Authentication features for signing requests to the HERE OAuth2.0 Authorization Server.  The 
  client provides its provisioned id and secret to make authenticated requests via the OAuth1.0 
  authentication method.
- Authorization features for obtaining HERE Access Tokens from the HERE OAuth2.0 Authorization 
  Server, including the ability to automatically refresh HERE Access Tokens.  Supported 
  flows include OAuth2.0 client_credentials grant for confidential clients.
- Authorization features for using OAuth2.0 Bearer HERE Access Token in the Authorization header 
  for requests to HERE Services.
- Accounting is provided by HERE Services using the signed claims from the HERE Access Token.

in the /lib directory to be available on your classpath.  By default, the /lib JARs
are referenced in the here-oauth-client's Class-Path.
